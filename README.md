# Hey, I'm Alex 👋

I'm a full-stack developer and builder who likes shipping **real, automated systems** from AI/agentic backends to fully automated trading engines.

Right now I'm mostly living at the intersection of:

- 🧠 AI agents & automation  
- 📈 Systematic trading  
- 🌐 Full-stack web (Django + React)

---

### 🚧 What I'm working on

- **TemporAI** – building an agentic finance / DeFi platform focused on automated portfolio workflows, risk-aware execution, and yield strategies.  
  _Role: Lead AI Product Developer (multi-agent systems, infra, and strategy plumbing)._

- **Automated Trading Engine** – a fully automated futures/crypto trading engine with:
  - Backtesting + walk-forward analysis
  - Live execution layer
  - Strategy config via code, not clicks

(These are mostly private right now, but I’ll open up more of the ecosystem over time.)

### 🛠 Tech & Tools I use a lot

**Core stack**

- Python (backend, data, infra)
- Django / DRF / FastAPI for APIs
- React / Next.js on the frontend
- Postgres, Redis, Celery

**Systems & infra**

- gRPC / REST microservices
- Docker
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- AWS / Azure

**Quant / DeFi / AI**

- Backtesting & execution engines
- DeFi APIs and on-chain data
- LLMs & multi-agent systems (tool use, planning, evaluation, etc.)

---

### ⭐ Projects & areas of interest

- 🧮 **Systematic trading** – building engines, not just strategies; focusing on risk frameworks and robustness.
- 🧠 **Agentic systems** – orchestrating multiple AI agents to do real work (research, decision-making, execution).
- 📦 **Real-world ops automation** – logistics-like problems, workflows, and “glue code” that ties messy systems together.

### ⚡ A bit more about me

- I like turning manual, error-prone workflows into **automated, observable systems**.
- I care a lot about **clean abstractions** around messy domains (finance, logistics, trading).
- Always down to jam on: AI agents, DeFi primitives, trading infrastructure, and weird side projects.
